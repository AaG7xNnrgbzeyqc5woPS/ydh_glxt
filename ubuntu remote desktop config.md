To configure remote desktop on Ubuntu, you can use the built-in VNC-compatible tool called Remmina. You can launch Remmina and select RDP in the drop-down box. Then enter the remote PC’s IP address and tap Enter. If you’re using Windows, you can click Start and type rdp. Look for the Remote Desktop Connection app and click Open. Input the IP address of your Ubuntu computer and click Connect1.


Alternatively, you can use xrdp to connect to a graphical desktop for your remote Ubuntu server over an RDP connection from a local machine2. You can also try configuring a VNC connection for your Linux server with How to Install and Configure VNC on Ubuntu 20.042.
